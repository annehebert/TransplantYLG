# YearsofLifeGainedfromTransplant

#### In progress 

This is a repository for code estimating the years of life gained through organ transplant from donors deceased of drug overdose deaths.

### Summary

The worsening opioid crisis in the United States has increased the availability of organs from donors who died of drug overdoses. We developed methods for quantifying the impact of this expanding organ donation source by estimating the years of life gained by recipients of overdose donor organs. We compare these gains to those from other organ donors and examine how differences in donor and recipient age distributions contribute to differential impact by donor type.
